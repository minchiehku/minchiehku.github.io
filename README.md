## GitHub Pages Website Setup Guide

`Note: This README was generated by Github Copilot`

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Basic static website files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.).
- Familiarity with basic Git operations.

### 2. Create a Repository
- Log in to your GitHub account, click the `+` in the top right, and select **New repository**.
- Enter a repository name, recommended format: `<username>.github.io`, for example: `yourusername.github.io`. 
- Set the repository to **Public** and optionally choose **Add a README file**. 
- Click **Create repository** to complete.

### 3. Upload Website Files

- Prepare all the static website files in your local environment (e.g., `index.html`).
- You can upload your files to GitHub in one of the following ways:
    - **Direct Upload via GitHub Web Interface**: Click **Add file** > **Upload files** in the repository, select your files, and upload.
    - **Upload Using Git**: If you are familiar with Git, you can create a local Git repository and push it to GitHub.

   Steps for uploading using Git:

    ```bash
    # MinChieh Ku — Personal Static Website

    This repository is a static personal resume / portfolio website. The site separates editable text content from the HTML structure by storing text in a structured JSON file (`content/data.json`). A client-side loader script (`assets/js/content-loader.js`) fetches the JSON at runtime and injects HTML into placeholders in `index.html`.

    Purpose
    - Make textual content easy to update without editing HTML.
    - Keep the site fully static so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any static host.
    - Preserve existing styles and layout (no CSS changes required).

    Key features
    - Centralized content in `content/data.json` (pageTitle, header, intro, education, projects, work, certifications, skills, languages)
    - Client-side renderer in `assets/js/content-loader.js`
    - Works with static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, static S3, etc.)

    Repository structure (important files)

    - `index.html` — page shell with placeholders (elements with `data-content-id` attributes)
    - `content/data.json` — structured text content used by the site
    - `assets/js/content-loader.js` — fetches JSON and injects HTML
    - `assets/css/devresume.css` — styling (unchanged)
    - `assets/fontawesome/` — icon assets
    - `assets/images/` — profile image and other images

    How content is organized

    `content/data.json` contains keys such as:
    - `pageTitle` (string) — used to set `document.title`
    - `header` (object) — name, taglines, contact links
    - `intro` (object) — image src, heading, paragraphs[]
    - `education`, `papers`, `projects`, `work` (arrays) — lists of items
    - `certifications`, `skills`, `languages`, `footer`, `contacts`

    Content JSON API
    -----------------

    The project exposes a single content endpoint at `/content/data.json` (relative to the site root). The client loader (`assets/js/content-loader.js`) performs a `GET` request to this path and expects a JSON object that follows the schema described below.

    Endpoint
    - GET /content/data.json — returns the full content object (application/json). Example:

    ```json
    {
        "pageTitle": "MinChieh Ku Resume",
        "header": { "name": "MinChieh Ku", "taglines": ["..."], "contacts": {"github":"..."} },
        "intro": { "image": "assets/images/resume-profile.PNG", "heading": "About Me", "paragraphs": ["..."] },
        "education": [ { "title": "...", "meta": "...", "content": "..." } ],
        "projects": [ { "title": "...", "bullets": ["..."], "link": "..." } ],
        "work": [ { "title": "...", "meta": "...", "bullets": ["..."] } ],
        "certifications": [ { "title": "...", "meta": "..." } ],
        "skills": { "technical": ["..."], "design": ["..."] },
        "languages": ["TOEIC 950"],
        "footer": "Copyright © Min-Chieh Ku"
    }
    ```

    Field reference (summary)
    - `pageTitle`: string — document title set by the loader.
    - `header`: object — `name` (string), `taglines` (array of strings), `contacts` (object: `github`, `email`, `location`).
    - `intro`: object — `image` (path), `heading` (string), `paragraphs` (array of HTML strings).
    - `education`: array — items with `title`, `meta`, `content`.
    - `papers`, `projects`: arrays — each item has `title` and `bullets` (array of HTML strings); `projects` may include optional `link`.
    - `work`: array — each item has `title`, `meta`, `bullets`.
    - `certifications`: array — items with `title` and `meta`.
    - `skills`: object — `technical` and `design` arrays of strings.
    - `languages`: array of strings.
    - `footer`: string — footer text.

    Usage notes
    - The loader expects HTML-safe strings for items that include markup (e.g., `<strong>`). Keep content sanitized when introducing external input.
    - Because this is a static JSON file, updates are performed by editing `content/data.json` and deploying (push to GitHub). If you need a runtime API to update content (e.g., admin UI), implement a small server-side endpoint that writes to this JSON and re-deploys or serves dynamic content.
    - Caching: static hosts may cache the JSON. To see changes immediately, clear browser cache or set cache-control headers on the host.

    Example client fetch (already implemented by `content-loader.js`)
    ```javascript
    fetch('/content/data.json')
        .then(r => r.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data.pageTitle));
    ```


    Editing content

    1. Edit `content/data.json` directly (local editor or GitHub web editor).
    2. Save and commit changes if using Git.
    3. If hosted on GitHub Pages, the site will update automatically after push; if testing locally, refresh the served page.

    Local testing (recommended)

    Do not open `index.html` with `file://` — the browser blocks `fetch()` for local files. Run a simple static server in the project root instead.

    Python 3 (built-in)
    ```powershell
    cd "d:\Project\Java_project\GithubPage"
    py -m http.server 8000
    # open http://localhost:8000
    ```

    Node (http-server via npx)
    ```powershell
    cd "d:\Project\Java_project\GithubPage"
    npx http-server -p 8000
    # open http://localhost:8000
    ```

    Deployment to GitHub Pages

    1. Create a GitHub repository and push the project files. For a user site, name the repo `yourusername.github.io`.
    2. Push the code:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial site"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

    3. On GitHub: go to the repository → Settings → Pages, choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, and save. Wait a few minutes for the site to be published.

    4. Optional: add an empty `.nojekyll` file at repo root if you do not want Jekyll processing.

    Notes and gotchas

    - Path and filename case sensitivity: GitHub Pages runs on Linux — file names and paths must match exact case.
    - `fetch()` requires serving over HTTP(S). GitHub Pages and static hosts are suitable.
    - `index.html` currently contains an empty `<title></title>` tag; `assets/js/content-loader.js` sets `document.title` from `content/data.json` (`pageTitle`) at runtime. Keeping a (possibly empty) title tag preserves fallback behavior if JS is disabled.

    Troubleshooting

    - If the page is empty when opened via `file://`, start a local server as shown above.
    - If the browser console shows a 404 when fetching `content/data.json`, confirm the file exists at `content/data.json` and that the server is serving it.
